What is a project?
A project is a temporary organisational structure which is setup to create a unique product or service (output)
within certain constraints such as time, cost, and quality.
 Temporary means that the project has a well-defined start and end.
 Unique output means that the project's product or service has not been created before. It may be similar to another product but there will always be a certain level of uniqueness.
 A project's output may be a product (e.g. new application) or a service (e.g. a consulting service, a conference or a training programme).
 The project is defined, planned and executed under certain external (or self-imposed) constraints of time, cost, quality, as well as other constraints related to the project's organisational environment, capabilities, available capacity, etc.
